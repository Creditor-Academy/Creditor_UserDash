# HuggingFace Inference Client Installation Guide

## Quick Fix for Current Error

The error you're seeing is because the `@huggingface/inference` package is not installed. This is an **optional dependency** for enhanced Qwen image generation.

## Option 1: Install the Package (Recommended)

To enable the advanced HuggingFace Inference Client features:

```bash
npm install @huggingface/inference
```

After installation, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Option 2: Use Without the Package (Current Fallback)

The system is already configured to work without this package. It will automatically:

1. ✅ **Detect** that the package is not available
2. ✅ **Log** a helpful message about the optional dependency
3. ✅ **Fallback** to direct API calls (which work just as well)
4. ✅ **Continue** with full functionality

## What You'll See in Console

### With Package Installed:
```
✅ HuggingFace Inference Client initialized
🚀 Using HuggingFace Inference Client for Qwen generation
```

### Without Package (Fallback):
```
⚠️ HuggingFace Inference Client not available, using direct API calls
💡 To enable advanced features, install: npm install @huggingface/inference
🔄 Using direct API calls for Qwen generation
```

## Benefits of Installing the Package

### With `@huggingface/inference`:
- ✨ **Enhanced API**: More robust error handling

   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
