# AI Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to implement a new AI course creation workflow with a sliding panel that opens from the right side with a gray color scheme, while maintaining the AI enhancement capabilities in the lesson editor.

## Changes Made

### 1. Implemented AI Course Creation Panel with Two-Panel Design
- **Approach**: Created a new AICourseCreationPanel with a two-panel layout that slides in from the right side
- **Design**: Features a course preview panel on the left and form inputs on the right, with a clean minimalist design
- **Reason**: Provide a dedicated workflow for AI course creation that matches the reference design while maintaining our theme

### 2. Created AIEnhancementPanel Component
- **New File**: `src/components/LessonBuilder/AIEnhancementPanel.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides AI functionality directly within the lesson editor
- **Features**:
  - Generate lesson outlines
  - Create lesson introductions
  - Generate lesson summaries
  - Custom AI prompts

### 3. Modified LessonHeader Component
- **File**: `src/components/LessonBuilder/LessonHeader.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added "AI Enhance" button
  - Imported Sparkles icon for AI functionality

### 4. Updated LessonBuilder Integration
- **File**: `src/pages/LessonBuilder/index.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added state for AI enhancement panel
  - Integrated AIEnhancementPanel component
  - Added handler functions for AI functionality

### 5. Updated CreateCourse Component
- **File**: `src/pages/CreateCourse.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added AICourseCreationPanel import
  - Added showAICoursePanel state
  - Updated handleCreateOptionSelect to open AICourseCreationPanel
  - Added AICourseCreationPanel JSX element

### 6. Replaced AIAssistedCourseModal with AICourseCreationPanel
- **File**: `src/components/courses/AICourseCreationPanel.jsx`
- **Status**: New component that replaces AIAssistedCourseModal
- **Purpose**: Provides a two-panel sliding interface for AI course creation with real-time preview and drag & drop file upload

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Create Course" button
2. User selects "AI Course" option from the creation options
3. AICourseCreationPanel slides in from the right side with a two-panel layout
4. User fills in course details in the right panel with real-time preview in the left panel
5. User can drag & drop a thumbnail image for the course
6. User generates AI content with the "Generate AI Outline" button
7. AI-generated outline appears in the preview panel
8. User can create the course with AI-generated content
9. For existing lessons, user can navigate to the lesson builder
10. User clicks the "AI Enhance" button in the lesson header
11. AI Enhancement Panel opens with options for:
    - Lesson outline generation
    - Introduction generation
    - Summary generation
    - Custom prompts
12. User selects an option and AI generates content
13. User can then use the generated content in their lesson

### Technical Implementation
- Uses Bytez SDK for AI functionality
- Supports multiple AI models through environment variables
- Provides fallback content generation when AI is unavailable
- Integrates seamlessly with existing lesson builder UI

## Environment Variables
The AI functionality requires the following environment variable:
```
VITE_BYTEZ_API_KEY=your_bytez_api_key_here
```

## Testing
Unit tests have been created for:
- AIEnhancementPanel component
- LessonHeader component

## Future Improvements
1. Implement content insertion from AI panel directly into lesson editor
2. Add more AI generation options (images, quizzes, etc.)
3. Improve error handling and user feedback
4. Add loading states and progress indicators
5. Implement history/undo functionality for AI-generated content
6. Enhance the AICourseCreationPanel with more advanced AI capabilities
7. Add AI content customization options in the course creation flow
8. Implement all tab functionalities in the AICourseCreationPanel (currently placeholders)
9. Add actual file upload functionality for course thumbnails
10. Implement real-time collaboration features in the AI course creation panel
